 *
 * \section about About
 *
 * lci is a LOLCODE interpreter written in C and is designed to be correct,
 * portable, fast, and precisely documented.
 *
 *   - correct: Every effort has been made to test lci's conformance to the
 *   LOLCODE language specification. Unit tests come packaged with the lci
 *   source code.
 *
 *   - portable: lci follows the widely ported ANSI C specification allowing it
 *   to compile on a broad range of systems.
 *
 *   - fast: Much effort has gone into producing simple and efficient code
 *   whenever possible to the extent that the above points are not compromized.
 *
 *   - precisely documented: lci uses Doxygen to generate literate code
 *   documentation, browsable here.
 *
 * \section organization Organization
 *
 * lci employs several different modules which each perform a specific task
 * during interpretation of code:
 *
 *   - \b lexer (lexer.c, lexer.h)- The lexer takes an array of characters and
 *   splits it up into individual \e lexemes.  Lexemes are divided by whitespace
 *   and other rules of the language.
 *
 *   - \b tokenizer (tokenizer.c, tokenizer.h) - The tokenizer takes the output
 *   of the lexer and converts it into individual \e tokens.  Tokens are
 *   different from lexemes in that a single token may be made up of multiple
 *   lexemes.  Also, the contents of some tokens are evaluated (such as integers
 *   and floats) for later use.
 *
 *   - \b parser (parser.c, parser.h) - The parser takes the output of the
 *   tokenizer and analyzes it semantically to turn it into a parse tree.
 *
 *   - \b interpreter (interpreter.c, interpreter.h) - The interpreter takes the
 *   output of the parser and executes it.
 *
 * Each of these modules is contained within its own C header and source code
 * files of the same name.
 *
 * To handle the conversion of Unicode code points and normative names to bytes,
 * two additional files, unicode.c and unicode.h are used.
 * 
 * Finally, main.c ties all of these modules together and handles the initial
 * loading of input data for the lexer.

/**
 * \page varscope Variable Scope
 *
 * The specification states that variables are local to the scope of the main
 * block or any function they are contained within--except for temporary loop
 * variables which are local to the loop they are instantiated within.  This
 * behavior, combined with the fact that variables must be declared before being
 * used, means that variables may not be shadowed in different control scopes
 * (such as loops and conditional statements) and, more importantly, programmers
 * must keep track of whether variables have been previously declared within
 * conditionally executed code (for example, under this scoping if a variable is
 * declared in a conditional block it cannot be safely used in later code).
 *
 * One advantage of a flat scoping scheme is that nearly everything can be
 * stored in a single structure, making lookups faster.  However, I believe that
 * this advantage is not worth the extra frustration transferred to the
 * programmer and so scoping in lci is done in a similar manner to other
 * programming languages, to wit, within
 *
 *   - the main block of code,
 *   - the body of functions,
 *   - the body of loop statements, and
 *   - the bodies of conditional statements.
 *
 * This should alleviate any confusion which may have been caused by using a
 * completely local free-for-all scope.  Also, there seems to be a general
 * consensus on the LOLCODE forums that this is the way to go and flat scoping
 * causes too many problems for the programmer.
